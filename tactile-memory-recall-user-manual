## Recording Spatial Memories (MAP Mode)

Spatial memories are recorded by associating finger poses with physical contact.

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Enter Mapping Mode**
   ```
   > MAP
   === MAPPING MODE ACTIVE ===
   Apply pressure to force sensors to record spatial memory...
   Press any key to exit mapping mode
   ```

2. **Position Your Fingers**
   - Arrange your thumb, index, and middle fingers in a meaningful spatial configuration
   - This could represent:
     - A specific location or landmark
     - A particular object or surface
     - An abstract spatial concept

3. **Apply Pressure**
   - Press firmly on the force sensors with your fingertips
   - Maintain pressure until recording begins
   - You'll see: `Force detected! Recording spatial memory...`

4. **Hold Steady for 3 Seconds**
   ```
   Recording for 3 seconds...
   Averaged 150 samples
   Spatial memory recorded in slot 0
   Pose: [45.67, -23.12, 8.90]
   ```

5. **Memory Confirmed**
   - The system automatically exits mapping mode
   - Your spatial memory is permanently stored
   - Ready to record additional memories (up to 5 total)

### Best Practices for Recording

**Consistent Hand Position:**
- Use the same reference point (e.g., table edge) for all recordings
- Maintain similar wrist orientation across sessions
- Ensure comfortable, reproducible finger positions

**Meaningful Associations:**
- Link finger poses to real spatial locations
- Use distinctive configurations that won't be confused
- Consider the physical context where you'll use the system

**Quality Control:**
- Verify each recording immediately using REPLAY mode
- Re-record if the pose feels uncomfortable or inconsistent
- Document your memory associations for reference

## Retrieving Spatial Memories (REPLAY Mode)

Once memories are stored, you can trigger haptic feedback by reproducing the recorded finger poses.

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Enter Replay Mode**
   ```
   > REPLAY
   === REPLAY MODE ACTIVE ===
   Move fingers to trigger haptic feedback...
   Press any key to exit replay mode
   ```

2. **Reproduce Finger Poses**
   - Move your fingers gradually toward a recorded position
   - The system continuously compares your current pose to stored memories
   - No need for exact precision - the system uses generous tolerance

3. **Haptic Feedback Activation**
   ```
   Spatial memory detected! Slot 0 (distance: 245.32Â°)
   ```
   - All three haptic motors activate simultaneously
   - Maximum intensity vibration provides clear feedback
   - Feedback continues while pose remains close to memory

4. **Memory Navigation**
   - Move between different finger poses to access different memories
   - Each stored memory has a unique "feel" and location
   - Haptic feedback stops when you move away from stored poses

### Replay Mode Features

**Automatic Timeout:**
- Replay mode automatically exits after 60 seconds of inactivity
- Prevents accidental battery drain
- Manual exit available anytime by pressing any key

**Multi-Memory Detection:**
- System can distinguish between all stored memories
- Closest match triggers haptic feedback
- Clear feedback indicates which memory slot was detected

**Tolerance System:**
- 300Â° tolerance allows for natural hand movement variation
- No need for millimeter-perfect reproduction
- Comfortable operation with reasonable precision requirements

## ðŸ”§ System Calibration

The calibration mode helps you understand sensor behavior and optimize system performance.

### Using Calibration Mode

1. **Enter Calibration**
   ```
   > CALIBRATE
   === CALIBRATION MODE ACTIVE ===
   Real-time sensor monitoring (30 second timeout)
   Format: Gyro[X,Y,Z] | FSR[T,I,M]
   Press any key to exit calibration mode
   ```

2. **Monitor Sensor Data**
   ```
   Gyro[12.3,45.6,-7.8] | FSR[23,156,89]
   Gyro[15.1,43.2,-8.9] | FSR[28,162,92]
   Gyro[11.8,46.1,-6.7] | FSR[19,148,87]
   ```

3. **Interpretation:**
   - **Gyro values**: Finger orientation in degrees/second
   - **FSR values**: Pressure readings (0-1023 range)
   - **Normal FSR**: ~0-50 (no pressure)
   - **Triggered FSR**: >150 (sufficient pressure)

### Calibration Applications

**Troubleshooting:**
- Verify all sensors respond to movement
- Check force sensor sensitivity
- Identify noisy or faulty sensors

**Performance Optimization:**
- Determine comfortable pressure thresholds
- Identify natural finger movement ranges
- Optimize pose recording positions

**Learning System Behavior:**
- Understand how finger movements affect readings
- Observe sensor noise and stability
- Plan optimal memory recording strategies

## Memory Management

### Viewing Stored Memories

Use the `STATUS` command to see all stored memories:
```
> STATUS
Stored Memory Details:
  Memory 0: [45.67, -23.12, 8.90]
  Memory 2: [12.34, 56.78, -9.01]
  Memory 4: [-5.43, 21.87, 67.23]
```

**Memory Slot Information:**
- Each memory shows its 3D pose coordinates [X, Y, Z]
- Empty slots are not displayed
- Maximum 5 memories can be stored simultaneously

### Clearing Memories

**Reset All Memories:**
```
> RESET
Resetting all spatial memories...
All memories cleared!
```

**Selective Memory Management:**
- Currently, individual memory deletion is not supported
- Use RESET to clear all memories and start fresh
- Plan memory recordings carefully due to 5-slot limit

### Memory Persistence

**Automatic Saving:**
- All memories are automatically saved to Arduino EEPROM
- Memories survive power cycles and system restarts
- No manual save operation required

**Power-On Recovery:**
```
System initialized successfully!
Loaded 3 memories from EEPROM
```

##  Troubleshooting Common Issues

### No Haptic Feedback in Replay Mode

**Possible Causes:**
- Finger pose not close enough to stored memory
- Stored memory corrupted or invalid
- Haptic motors not functioning

**Solutions:**
1. Try `TESTMOTOR` to verify haptic functionality
2. Use `CALIBRATE` to monitor real-time pose data
3. Re-record memories if poses seem inconsistent
4. Check hardware connections if motors don't respond

### Difficulty Recording Memories

**Possible Causes:**
- Force sensors not detecting sufficient pressure
- Finger pose changing during 3-second recording period
- Maximum memory capacity reached (5 memories)

**Solutions:**
1. Apply firmer pressure to force sensors
2. Hold finger position steady throughout recording
3. Use `RESET` if memory capacity is full
4. Check `STATUS` to verify available memory slots

### Inconsistent Memory Detection

**Possible Causes:**
- Hand position reference point changed
- Finger poses not distinctive enough
- Sensor drift or calibration issues

**Solutions:**
1. Use consistent reference positioning (same table, chair, etc.)
2. Record more distinctive finger pose differences
3. Re-calibrate system with `CALIBRATE` mode
4. Re-record problematic memories with clearer distinctions

### System Not Responding

**Possible Causes:**
- Serial communication issues
- Power supply problems
- Software crashed or locked up

**Solutions:**
1. Check USB connection and Serial Monitor settings (115200 baud)
2. Restart Arduino by pressing reset button
3. Re-upload software if problems persist
4. Verify power supply stability and connections
